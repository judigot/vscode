# General

- I want the code to be self-documenting.
- Don't suggest to run terminal commands.
- I prefer readable code that I can go back to after a long time and still be able to understand it.
- Use "current datetime" for chat titles.
- Show code before explanations.
- Avoid Nano; use Vim-compatible instructions.
- ESLint: Follow 'plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked'.
- I want short, semantic git commit messages. I want it to be a short summary of the changes made

# Terminal

- Write all shell scripts and command examples as POSIX-compliant `sh` scripts, avoiding Bash/Zsh-specific features.
- Always use MSYS2 bash terminal instead of PowerShell for all terminal commands
- When running bash commands, explicitly source the .bashrc file: `C:/apportable/Programming/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe --login -c "source /c/Users/<user>/.bashrc && <command>"`
- Use bash syntax
- When running bash commands that need aliases or functions from .snippetsrc, explicitly source /c/Users/Jude/.snippetsrc after sourcing .bashrc
- Use `shopt -s expand_aliases && eval <alias>` when running aliases in non-interactive shells via bash -c
- If you need to change the same code like one-liners across multiple files, use terminal commands rather than changing the files manually.

# TypeScript/JavaScript

- Never add console.log. You can add console.error
- Use unknown instead of any.
- Prefer interfaces (prefix with "I") over types.
- Wrap variables in String() when interpolating.
- Avoid unnecessary type casts.
- Handle null, undefined, 0, or NaN explicitly.
- Always use braces for void arrow functions.
- Always escape dollar signs when using template literals

# React

- Use function components only.
- Include all dependencies in hooks.
- Fix click handlers on non-interactive elements.

# Formatting

- Block Comments: Use `/* This is a comment */` for inline comments.
- SQL: Use heredoc syntax.

# Shell/Bash

- Avoid grep; prefer awk.
- Follow this structure in script files:

  ```shell
  #!/bin/sh
  
  readonly GLOBAL_VARIABLE="Hello, World!"
  
  readonly PROJECT_DIRECTORY=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" || exit 1; pwd) # Directory of this script
  
  main() {
      action1
      action2
  }
  
  action1() {
      cd "$PROJECT_DIRECTORY" || exit 1
      printf '%s\n' "Action 1"
  }
  
  action2() {
      cd "$PROJECT_DIRECTORY" || exit 1
      printf '%s\n' "Action 2"
  }
  
  main "$@"
  ```
- Omit unused global variables.
